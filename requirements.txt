# This is the root requirements.txt file for the Industrial AI Agents project.
# It includes common dependencies and those required by the sub-modules (IDOCA and ITISA).
# It's generally recommended to also maintain separate requirements.txt files
# within each sub-module (e.g., idoca/requirements.txt, itisa/requirements.txt)
# if they have distinct dependencies or if you want to manage their environments separately.
# This root file can be used to set up an environment for running both agents.

# --- Core AI/LLM Frameworks & Interactions ---
langchain
langchain-core
langchain-community
langchain-text-splitters
langchain-ollama
langgraph
smolagents
ollama # Python client for Ollama
litellm # Used by smolagents for broader LLM provider support
python-dotenv # For loading .env files

# --- Data Handling, Analysis & Document Processing ---
pandas # For data manipulation, especially in ITISA
numpy # For numerical operations, dependency for many libraries
scikit-learn # For machine learning tasks (e.g., anomaly detection in ITISA)
statsmodels # For statistical models (e.g., time series decomposition in ITISA)
unstructured # For document parsing in IDOCA.
# For full PDF support with 'unstructured', you might need to install optional dependencies:
# pip install "unstructured[pdf]"
# This often includes libraries like pdfminer.six, pikepdf.
Pillow # For image processing (used in IDOCA)

docling
langchain-docling

# --- Vector Database ---
chromadb # For RAG in IDOCA

# --- Plotting & User Interface ---
plotly # For interactive plots in ITISA
gradio # For UI in both IDOCA and ITISA

# --- Optional: Development & Linting Tools ---
# You might want to add these for development, but they are not strictly required to run the agents.
# autopep8
# flake8
# pytest

# --- Notes ---
# 1. Specific versions: For production or more stable environments,
#    you should pin package versions, e.g., pandas==2.0.3.
#    You can generate a pinned list from your working virtual environment using:
#    pip freeze > requirements.txt
#
# 2. Docling: If using Docling for advanced PDF parsing in IDOCA,
#    it's often run via Docker. If you need the Python package:
#    # docling
#    However, check its specific installation instructions as it might have other dependencies.
