# Examples and Tutorials

Welcome to the Examples and Tutorials section for the Industrial AI Agents project. This section is intended to provide practical demonstrations, use cases, and step-by-step guides to help you understand and utilize the capabilities of IDOCA and ITISA.

## Overview

The examples provided here aim to illustrate:
* How to prepare your data for each agent.
* Common workflows for interacting with the agents.
* Advanced use cases and customization options.
* How to interpret the outputs and results from the agents.

We plan to include Jupyter notebooks, script examples, and detailed walkthroughs for various industrial scenarios.

## IDOCA (Industrial Document Analysis Agent) Examples

* **Tutorial 1: Setting up your first RAG pipeline with IDOCA.**
    * *Description:* A step-by-step guide to uploading a set of sample technical manuals, processing them, and asking basic questions.
    * *Link:* `[Link to Tutorial 1 - IDOCA Basic RAG]` (To be added)
* **Tutorial 2: Using Agentic RAG in IDOCA for Complex Queries.**
    * *Description:* Demonstrates how to leverage the agentic capabilities of IDOCA to answer multi-hop questions or use specialized tools alongside document retrieval.
    * *Link:* `[Link to Tutorial 2 - IDOCA Agentic RAG]` (To be added)
* **Example Notebook: Analyzing Safety Data Sheets (SDS).**
    * *Description:* A Jupyter notebook showing how to use IDOCA to extract critical safety information from a collection of SDS documents.
    * *Link:* `[Link to Example - IDOCA SDS Analysis]` (To be added)
* **Example: Processing and Querying Maintenance Logs.**
    * *Description:* A guide on using IDOCA to find patterns or specific entries in maintenance logs.

## ITISA (Industrial Time Series Analysis Agent) Examples

* **Tutorial 1: Basic Time Series Plotting and Exploration with ITISA.**
    * *Description:* A beginner's guide to uploading a sample CSV, loading it, and generating basic plots and statistical summaries using natural language.
    * *Link:* `[Link to Tutorial 1 - ITISA Basic Analysis]` (To be added)
* **Tutorial 2: Anomaly Detection with ITISA.**
    * *Description:* Shows how to use ITISA to detect anomalies in a time series dataset using different methods (e.g., Z-score, Isolation Forest) through natural language commands.
    * *Link:* `[Link to Tutorial 2 - ITISA Anomaly Detection]` (To be added)
* **Example Notebook: Analyzing Sensor Data from a Manufacturing Process.**
    * *Description:* A Jupyter notebook demonstrating a more in-depth analysis of sample sensor data, including trend analysis and correlation plotting.
    * *Link:* `[Link to Example - ITISA Sensor Data Analysis]` (To be added)
* **Example: Customizing and Adding New Tools to ITISA.**
    * *Description:* A technical guide on how to define and integrate your own custom Python analysis tools into the ITISA framework.
    * *Link:* `[Link to Example - ITISA Custom Tools]` (To be added)

## General Examples

* **Tutorial: Integrating with Open WebUI.**
    * *Description:* How to use the agents (or just the Ollama models) with the Open WebUI interface for a different chat experience.
    * *Link:* `[Link to Tutorial - Open WebUI Integration]` (To be added)
* **Example: Generating Synthetic Datasets.**
    * *Description:* If you have scripts in `datasets/generators/`, this could link to a guide on how to use them to create sample data for testing.
    * *Link:* `[Link to Example - Synthetic Data Generation]` (To be added)
