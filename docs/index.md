# Industrial AI Agents - Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Industrial AI Agents project. This project provides open-source AI agents designed for local deployment in industrial settings, focusing on document analysis and time series data analysis.

## Introduction

These documents aim to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding, setting up, using, and extending the AI agents developed in this repository. Whether you are looking to deploy these agents as-is, customize them for your specific needs, or learn about building similar systems, this documentation should serve as a valuable resource.

The agents are built with a "local-first" and "open-source" philosophy, prioritizing data privacy, control, and accessibility for users with modest hardware resources.

## Navigation

This documentation is organized into the following sections:

* **[Getting Started](getting_started.md)**: Essential information for setting up your environment, installing dependencies, and running the agents for the first time. Includes system prerequisites and quick installation guides.
* **[Architecture Overview](architecture.md)**: A high-level look at the design principles, core components, and data flow patterns for both the Document Analysis Agent (IDOCA) and the Time Series Analysis Agent (ITISA).
* **Agent-Specific Documentation**:
    * **[IDOCA - Industrial Document Analysis Agent](idoca/index.md)**: Detailed documentation for IDOCA, covering its RAG-based architecture, document processing pipeline, setup, usage, customization, and example queries.
    * **[ITISA - Industrial Time Series Analysis Agent](itisa/index.md)**: Detailed documentation for ITISA, focusing on its function-calling architecture, available tools for data analysis and visualization, setup, usage, and example queries.
* **[Examples and Tutorials](examples/index.md)**: Practical examples, use cases, and tutorials to help you understand how to leverage the agents for various industrial tasks. This section may include Jupyter notebooks or step-by-step guides.
* **[Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md)**: Solutions to common issues, error messages, and tips for debugging problems you might encounter during setup or operation.
* **[Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md)**: Guidelines for how you can contribute to the project, report issues, or suggest enhancements. (Links to the main repository `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
* **[License](../LICENSE)**: Information about the project's open-source license. (Links to the main repository `LICENSE` file)

## Project Goals

* Provide practical, locally deployable AI agents for common industrial tasks.
* Offer an educational resource for learning about AI agent development.
* Promote the use of open-source tools in industrial AI.
* Enable extensibility for new data types and industrial use cases.

We hope this documentation helps you get the most out of the Industrial AI Agents project! If you have suggestions for improving the documentation, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
